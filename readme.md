# What is it

That's just a local envitoment for more flexible testing some problem solutions.

# Usage

To test all solutions run:

```shell
npm test
```

Or to run test on a specific solution just add it's folder name as a parameter, for example:

```shell
npm test /src/735.AsteroidCollision
```

P.S. No need to type the whole folder name, just press "Tab" after you wrote enough to predict what you want
